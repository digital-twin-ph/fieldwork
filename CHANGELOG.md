# Fieldwork release notes

The application version follows the policy in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). A version
shown in a local build is not a claim that it has been published.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-07

- Make Map outputs standalone communication views with configurable title,
  subtitle, visible map key, source/method note and local SVG export. Interactive
  polygon maps can choose no basemap, OpenStreetMap streets or OpenTopoMap
  terrain; online tiles are requested only for the current view and are absent
  from the SVG. Record the bounded map plan in N3 and validate it with SHACL.
  Existing saved maps default to local geometry; no migration is required.
  Validation covers structural evidence and Chromium interaction, not
  cartographic suitability or the correctness of source citations.

- Add an opt-in, locally bundled Vega-Lite Chart enhancement for the existing
  categorical counts: bar or dot marks, orientation, title, subtitle, axis
  labels, optional color legend, source note, SVG export,
  an underlying values table and an inspectable specification. Classic bars
  remain the default for saved workflows; no migration is required.
- Record the bounded chart specification in N3 and validate its structure with
  SHACL. This does not establish scientific correctness, chart suitability or
  practitioner comprehension. Local browser and cross-browser validation are
  recorded in [the spike note](docs/experiments/37-vega-lite-chart-spike.md).
- No saved-workflow migration is required. The release build passed 101 unit
  tests, ontology and widget validation, and a Chromium desktop/narrow-screen
  version check. Scientific suitability and Firefox/WebKit behavior remain
  unverified for this release.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-07

- Add a collapsible widget library and full-screen workbench and Results views,
  with Escape to restore the normal layout. No workflow migration is required.
- Add a John Snow geoprivacy experiment with configurable donut displacement,
  H3 cell aggregation, private before views, derived after maps/tables, and demo
  GeoJSON downloads. Compare original and moved locations in side-by-side maps
  with mean centers and pump context. The notebook map-encryption transform and contextual hide
  operation remain planned. No workflow migration is required.
- Expose Mean center as a reusable processing widget on both original and moved
  branches; Compare point sets consumes their typed outputs and verifies source
  identity, CRS, and counts. Existing saved comparisons retain their earlier
  three-input behavior.
- Local validation passed 99 unit tests and 60 Chromium browser scenarios,
  including the Botswana WorldPop GeoTIFF, desktop and narrow-screen version
  badge, positive and negative SHACL cases, and N3/evidence inspection.
  Privacy effectiveness and Firefox/WebKit behavior are not established.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-07

- Display the application version next to the Fieldwork mark, sourced from the
  root package version.
- Establish a versioning policy that distinguishes application releases from
  widget, ontology, workflow schema, and project revision versions.
- Add this release-note record.
- No workflow migration is required. The local build, widget and ontology checks,
  and a desktop/narrow-screen browser check passed. Broader browser regression
  runs are part of the publication pipelines.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-07

- Publish the browser-based visual GIS prototype to GitLab Pages and replicate
  the same source commit to GitHub Pages.
- Add shared study-area, point, raster, network, catchment, map, table, and chart
  workflow primitives, including the Old Naledi and John Snow worked examples.
- Export N3 and provenance evidence, validate runtime RDF with SHACL development
  checks, and package local projects with their binary reference assets.
- Validate the release with 94 unit tests and 57 distinct Chromium scenarios.
  Firefox, WebKit, and scientific outcome validation remain open.
