/** OpenFreeMap serves VECTOR tiles, not raster, so these cannot be an `L.tileLayer` URL.
 *
 *  The practitioner asked for them on 2026-10-17: *"OpenFreeMap has more to offer down the road
 *  in terms of communication stage."* That is the right reason to want them — Positron, Liberty
 *  and Bright are cartographic DESIGNS, not just another tile server, and choosing one is the
 *  kind of judgment [118](../docs/experiments/118-cartographic-judgment-as-rules.md) records as
 *  `selected` rather than inferred.
 *
 *  Vector styles need MapLibre GL. The renderer is not swapped: `@maplibre/maplibre-gl-leaflet`
 *  puts a MapLibre canvas underneath the existing Leaflet layers, so everything this application
 *  draws — the polygons, the 188 markers, the layer control — is untouched and only layer 0
 *  changes.
 *
 *  **Attribution comes from the source and is not added here.** The TileJSON at
 *  `tiles.openfreemap.org/planet` carries its own `attribution` -- OpenFreeMap, OpenMapTiles and
 *  OpenStreetMap, linked -- which MapLibre surfaces through the bridge into Leaflet's control.
 *  Adding it by hand produced a near-duplicate credit that outlived the layer, because Leaflet
 *  refcounts attributions and the source's copy is removed with the layer while a hand-added one
 *  is not. Caught in WebKit on 2026-10-17. The obligation was already being met.
 *
 *  Data is OpenStreetMap; the project is MIT; there is no key and no stated request limit.
 *  Offline bulk download is capped at 3,000 tiles or 50 MB by their terms, which this
 *  application never approaches because it fetches only what is viewed. */
