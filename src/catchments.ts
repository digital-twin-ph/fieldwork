 *  recorded as the blocker `isochrone-does-not-scale`. */
/** Lines buffered in small batches and unioned in a balanced tree, rather than handed to the
 *  buffer engine all at once.
 *
 *  A buffer distributes over a union, so the strip around a set of streets is the union of the
 *  strips around each -- which means the batch size is free to choose and the answer does not
 *  change with it. Measured 2026-10-13 on a real 10-minute walk over central London (3,925
 *  streets):
 *
 *  | all at once (shipped) | 17,175 ms | +4,599 MB |
 *  | batches of 400        |  3,083 ms |   +195 MB |
 *  | batches of 100        |  2,635 ms |    +82 MB |
 *  | **batches of 25**     |  **2,532 ms** | **+21 MB** |
 *  | batches of 1          |  6,416 ms |    +36 MB |
 *
 *  So 25 is the floor on both axes: below it the per-call overhead of the buffer engine dominates,
 *  above it the engine's own cost grows faster than the saving. The resulting area differs from the
 *  shipped geometry by 0.000006% -- 1 m² in 987,859 -- which is union ordering in floating point.
 *
 *  This is what made a 1 km square of central London exhaust a 4 GB heap: not the search, which
 *  takes 82 ms, but one buffer call over every reached street at once.
 *
 *  The union is a balanced pairwise reduction, not a left fold: folding re-walks the whole
 *  accumulated polygon on every step, which is the same quadratic shape in a different place. */

/** D3 -- the walk off the last junction to a door -- modelled rather than drawn.
 *
 *  Until 2026-10-14 the corridor was a constant `bufferM` strip around every reached street,
 *  including the streets at the very edge of the budget. Someone standing there has nothing left
 *  to walk, so the catchment claimed 25 m of ground beyond the time it was drawn for, all the way
 *  round its own boundary. The strip was described in the widget's note as a cartographic halo
 *  standing in for D3, which is a way of saying the third segment was not modelled at all.
 *
 *  It is now a LEG WITH A BUDGET. At any point on the route the walk off the network is
 *  `min(bufferM, what is left)`, so the corridor is full width while there is time to spare and
 *  tapers to nothing where the time runs out. `bufferM` stops being a drawing width and becomes
 *  the furthest anyone is assumed to walk off a street at the end of the route -- a cap, because
 *  without one the model lets you leave the network at the origin and walk the whole budget in a
 *  straight line, which is the crow-flies proxy the network routing exists to avoid.
 *
 *  The route is buffered whole: D1 (the straight walk onto the network), D2 (the streets) and D3
 *  (this). The practitioner's instruction of 2026-10-14 -- "connect D1, D2 and D3 and that's what
 *  you buffer". Experiment 114.
 *
 *  Chunking, and what it costs: a chunk takes the budget left at the END it is furthest along,
 *  so the near end of a chunk is buffered by less than it has earned, and the radius is rounded
 *  down into buckets as well. Both remove ground. Against that, each chunk is buffered on its
 *  own, so its far end gets a round cap at the chunk's radius where the rule gives a smaller one,
 *  which adds a little back. They do not cancel exactly: the Validation Lab's check 08 rebuilds
 *  the rule independently at 1 m steps and measures this corridor 0.16% LARGER than the rule
 *  (161,044 m² against 160,785 m², symmetric difference 0.16%, 2026-10-14). So the approximation
 *  is not purely conservative, and that is stated rather than assumed.
