/** A LAB EVALUATION PASS: one evaluator's findings against Nielsen's ten usability heuristics, for one screen.
 *
 *  Experiment 184. The practitioner, 2026-11-07: *"Perhaps we can make a pop up form for this JK evaluation for test
 *  sections e.g. widgets so it is in the workflow and can be saved to laptop so it can be reviewed."* Shown only when
 *  lab evaluation is switched on; saved as Markdown to read and JSON to merge.
 *
 *  Finding and rating are separate on purpose: Nielsen's guidance is to collect problems first and have each evaluator
 *  rate the merged list alone. So a pass holds findings and no severity.
 *
 *  The heuristics' names are Nielsen's (nngroup.com, 1994, reviewed 2024); the one-line questions are this project's.
 *  The form's own words are kept to labels and those questions, because the evaluation's first lens is design
 *  explanation crowding the screen. */
