/** THE ARTIFACT ITSELF, IN THE WRITE-UP.
 *
 *  The practitioner, 2026-10-30, after three rounds of being told this was built: *"We are still
 *  far from making progress - charts, maps and tables are not there."*
 *
 *  **AND THEY WERE NOT.** `artifact-notes.ts` machines a sentence ABOUT each artifact -- 32 rows
 *  keyed by group, 4 layers bottom to top, 32 bars one per group -- and that sentence is what
 *  landed in Results. Measured in the running application on 2026-10-30, the Notes view held 70
 *  typeset equations, 0 tables, 0 charts and 0 maps. The equations had appeared because for an
 *  equation the description IS the artifact; for a table it is not, and nothing had noticed.
 *
 *  The instruction that produced the wrong thing was *"add the tables next, then maps, then
 *  charts as machined notes"*, read as "prose a widget machines" when it meant the artifact lands
 *  in the write-up. The description is not withdrawn -- it is the material a caption is written
 *  from, which is what 141 settled it was for -- but it is no longer the whole of what Results
 *  carries.
 *
 *  RENDERED FROM THE RUN, NOT STORED. The practitioner chose a live render over a figure captured
 *  at run time, and the write-up store deliberately keeps notes and never run outputs: six
 *  workflows of geometry and rasters would put megabytes in `localStorage` to show a paragraph.
 *  So a figure is drawn from the run held in memory, and a workflow that has not run this session
 *  shows its description and no figure -- which is what the Run control on the Notes tab is for.
 *  The cost is stated rather than hidden: a reloaded write-up has its words and not its figures
 *  until the workflows are run, the same bargain `runAt` already declares for the words.
 *
 *  THE SAME RENDERERS THE APPLICATION ALREADY USES, deliberately. A table goes through
 *  `tableViewOf`, which is what Quick Look renders, and a chart through `chartMarkup`, which is
 *  what the bars tab renders. A second renderer here would be a second thing to keep in step, and
 *  a figure in the write-up that disagreed with the figure on the screen is the one failure this
 *  module cannot be allowed to have.
 *
 *  A MAP IS A STATIC FIGURE, on the practitioner's reasoning of 2026-10-30: *"Because it's for a
 *  publication, we should render the static map."* Which settles a question this module first got
 *  wrong by looking at the wrong code. The map DOWNLOAD is built from `svg.innerHTML`, so it
 *  looked as though a map could only be had by rendering one; but what fills that element is
 *  `oldMap`, a pure function of the output, and `mapPresentation` is a pure function of the node
 *  and the run. So the figure is composed from the run exactly as the tables and charts are,
 *  through the same `standaloneMapSvg` the Download map (SVG) button calls.
 *
 *  AND IT IS NOT YET THE WHOLE FIGURE, which this comment claimed for an hour on 2026-10-30 and
 *  which was wrong. The live map is `oldMap` AND an asynchronous pass that fetches basemap tiles
 *  or a georeferenced plate, inserts them above the background rect, and then withdraws the fill
 *  from polygons that encode nothing so the ground shows through. The download copies
 *  `svg.innerHTML` after all of that; this composed only the vector plot. On South London's
 *  layered maps the two therefore differed -- the write-up's figure had the extent and the marks
 *  and not Snow's plate underneath -- which was visible the moment the figure and the screen were
 *  put side by side, and was not visible in any assertion.
 *
 *  THE PLATE IS IN THE FIGURE NOW, and the tiles are still out. That was one gap in this comment
 *  and is two: a tile has to be fetched, so composing one here would make a figure that renders
 *  and then changes under a reader, while a plate is a data URI the node already holds and
 *  `mapImageMarkup` places it by its corners -- a pure function of the node and the frame. The
 *  caller composes it through `withGroundUnder` before this module is reached, so what arrives
 *  at `mapFigure` carries its ground. What remains open is the basemap, and what would close it
 *  is unchanged: compose it when the run is remembered, not when the note is drawn.
 *
 *  The markup is passed in rather than composed here, because resolving a node and a workflow
 *  belongs to the application that holds them. This module decides WHETHER a map is drawn and
 *  what stands where one cannot be.
