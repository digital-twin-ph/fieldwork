/** A KEY THAT DISAGREES WITH ITS PLOT IS WORSE THAN NO KEY, because the reader trusts it.
 *
 *  Found twice on 2026-10-25, in two different renderers, by rendering the figures and looking:
 *
 *  - the static point map drew every mark as a circle coloured by STATUS while its key named one
 *    hue and mark per source layer, so Snow's eight pumps were indistinguishable from 250 deaths;
 *  - the isochrone plot drew `gray` observations and `red` sites while its key named Okabe-Ito's
 *    #CC79A7 and #E69F00 and drew the sites as squares.
 *
 *  The second is the worse of the two. `red` on `gray` is the pair that fails first under the
 *  commonest colour vision deficiencies, and neither colour is in the declared palette -- which
 *  is exactly what `CategoricalPaletteIsColourBlindSafe` exists to prevent, on a figure it was
 *  not being applied to. A rule that holds only where somebody remembered to apply it is a rule
 *  about remembering.
 *
 *  This asserts the agreement itself rather than the colours, so a palette change moves both
 *  sides together and the test keeps meaning the same thing. */
