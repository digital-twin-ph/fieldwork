/** THE WRITE-UP IS THE PROJECT'S, NOT THE OPEN WORKFLOW'S.
 *
 *  The practitioner, 2026-10-30, after the Notes tab was found holding one workflow's artifacts:
 *  *"This is not the model we are building. It's supposed to hold notes from all workflows in
 *  that project."*
 *
 *  THE DEFECT THIS HOLDS OUT. `result` in `app.ts` is one variable holding the open workflow's
 *  last run, nulled on every workflow switch. The Notes tab read it directly, so a six-workflow
 *  investigation showed one workflow's notes at a time and a freshly opened project showed none.
 *  Every test written for the machined notes ran ONE workflow and then looked, so none of them
 *  could see it -- which is why this drives the real sequence a practitioner does instead.
 *
 *  Nothing here injects state through `localStorage`: the write-up is built by running workflows
 *  in the interface, because the two silent setup traps recorded in
 *  `tests/version-supersession.browser.mjs` are exactly how a test like this comes to assert
 *  against the published template. */

 *  once, almost none of them about a count -- the others were waiting on an import toast and
 *  pinned the number that happened to be in it.
 *
 *  The example is pinned by digest and RE-PINNED as it grows, three times in one day, so a
 *  literal here is a second place the number lives and the two drift silently until a gate runs.
 *  These tests already read the bundle to serve it, so the project can be asked instead. What is
